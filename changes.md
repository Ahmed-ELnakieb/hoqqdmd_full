## Technical Notes

### Asset Path Structure Issue (Previously Resolved)
- The website currently uses assets from multiple locations:
  - Root `img/` folder for images
  - Root `css/` and `js/` folders for styles and scripts
  - `assets/` folder contains duplicate resources
  - Logo changes should be made in the root `img/logo/` folder, not `assets/img/logo/`

### File Locations
- Main header file: `includes/header.php`
- Main footer file: `includes/footer.php`
- Logo files location: `img/logo/`
- Background images location: `img/bg/`
